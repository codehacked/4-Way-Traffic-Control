# 4-Way-Traffic-Control
The 4-Way Traffic Control project uses an 8051 microcontroller to automate traffic lights at an intersection. It manages the red, yellow, and green lights for four directions, ensuring smooth traffic flow and reducing congestion. The microcontroller handles precise timing and sequencing of the lights, adjusting to traffic conditions with preset intervals to enhance efficiency and safety at the intersection.
